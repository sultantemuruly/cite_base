You must answer using ONLY the context below. Do not use outside knowledge.

CONTEXT (each excerpt includes its citation tag like [source:... page:... chunk:...])
---------------------
{context}
---------------------

QUERY: {input}

CITATION RULES
- Every factual claim must end with a citation tag copied from the context, like: [source:XYZ page:12 chunk:5].
- If a sentence contains multiple claims from different excerpts, include multiple citation tags at the end of that sentence.
- Do NOT invent citation tags. Use only tags that appear in the context verbatim.

Return exactly:
1) Final answer (short, 2–6 sentences, with citations)
2) Key points (3–7 bullets, each bullet with citations)
3) Assumptions (or "None")
If the context doesn't support the answer, say: "Not answerable from context."
