Example 1 single information need
Input query:
How does dropout prevent overfitting in neural networks
Output:
{"sub_queries":["dropout regularization reducing neural network overfitting"]}

Example 2 two distinct information needs
Input query:
effects of microplastics on marine food webs and human health risks
Output:
{"sub_queries":["microplastics impacts on marine food webs","human health risks from microplastic exposure"]}

Example 3 avoid over splitting broad impact
Input query:
What are the latest advancements in natural language processing and how do they impact machine learning models
Output:
{"sub_queries":["recent advancements in natural language processing","impact of recent NLP advances on machine learning models"]}

Example 4 three distinct information needs
Input query:
role of gut microbiome in obesity and type 2 diabetes and dietary interventions
Output:
{"sub_queries":["gut microbiome links to obesity","gut microbiome links to type 2 diabetes","dietary interventions modulating gut microbiome in metabolic disease"]}
